# AI-BASED-CHATBOT-FOR-INDUSTRIAL-PROCESS-MONITORING-FOR-PAPERCUTTING-MACHINE
For industry 4.0 to provide way to create a truly objective measures of production and hence industries performance.

Many companies dedicated specific employees to monitor their production lines, since problems can occur at virtually any point in manufacturing, that might leave operator or manufacturer guessing from where certain defects or delays originate which gives a limited view of what is going on in one place at a given time, thus monitors the process flow and fix malfunctions or faults in not real-time way and hence lead to inefficiency industrial performance.

This problem associates with the manual monitoring approach where the operator should be present physically around the machine to sets parameter and oversee the operation state of the machine from the start of production, through different manufacturing stages, and all the way to final inspection. This has courageâ€™s to the development of industrial process monitoring system that will offer remote control and monitoring of the machine and its process. So instructions and parameter setting to machine will be provide from this system and feedback about the operation faults and current states will be present. Provision of command instructions and getting feedbacks through the system in real time way is like conversation between the operator providing instructions and the monitoring system providing state feedback, hence AI based chatbot (conversational agent) is proposed and developed to be industrial process monitoring system for the early method of being almost around machine where now through this chatbot will monitor machine remotely while being in a single position unless on the time of resolving detected faults.
